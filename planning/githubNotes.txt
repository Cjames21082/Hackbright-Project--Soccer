### Branch Control

Create the branch on your local machine :

$ git branch <name_of_your_new_branch>
Push the branch on github :

$ git push origin <name_of_your_new_branch>
Switch to your new branch :

$ git checkout <name_of_your_new_branch>
When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.

You can see all branches created by using

$ git branch 
Which will show :

* approval_messages
  master
  master_clean
Add a new remote for you branch :

$ git remote add <name_of_your_remote> <url>
Push changes from your commit into your branch :

$ git push origin <name_of_your_remote>
Delete a branch on your local filesytem :

$ git branch -d <name_of_your_new_branch>
Delete the branch on github :

$ git push origin :<name_of_your_new_branch>
The only difference it's the : to say delete.

If you want to change default branch, it's so easy with github, in your fork go into Admin and in the drop-down list default branch choose what you want.
